Location: 4625 Springfield Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19143

Place Name: Saint Francis De Sales Catholic Church

Description: Synethisizing Byzantine with loosely Spanish Catholic visual and architectural design strategies, the Saint Francis De Sales Catholic Church in West Philadelphia at the intersection of 47th Street and Springfield Avenue has not been the subject of serious study. My advisor and I have discussed it as a potential paper topic or blog post as its size, eclecticism, and intersection with my personal interest in the utilization of neo-Byzantine architecture, particularly in suprising places such as this Catholic context.
